## About
**NOTE:** Rigth now, parts of the project is only a proof-of-concept, and it will be updated and fully implemented in the following months with the actual integration of the rovers' hardware.

**SASA** - Sapienza Aerospace Student Association is an open student association, whose objectives are the promotion and dissemination of aerospace culture, as well as the improvement of university teaching through practical activities and simulations of work experiences. The Associationis subdivided into different teams, everyone with different purposes. 

We are the **Sapienza Technology Team (STT)**, born initially with the aim of providing and developing the knowledge of hardware and software suitable for the construction of real rover operating even remotely and independently. Programming languages such as Phyton, Node.JS, web development and so on are developed, while CAD programs such as Solid Edge are used for solid modeling in 2D and 3D. The goal of the team for this year is to enhance the Aeneas rover started the previous year by making it waterproof and capable of facing even the most adverse weather conditions, the introduction of a radar capable of detecting nearby obstacles also useful to the system autonomous driving that is developing and much more.

This repository contains the **Ground Station** (controller) of all the rover we have developed, ready to use and easy to adapt to other rovers.
